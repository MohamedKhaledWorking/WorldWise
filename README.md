# WorldWise
WorldWise is a simple React app for tracking the cities you’ve visited around the world. Users can select locations on an interactive map, save notes, and view all their travels in one place. Built as part of Jonas Schmedtmann’s React course, the project focuses on core React concepts, state management, and working with map components.
